  <h1>What is Pandas</h1>

  <p>
    PANDAS is an acronym standing for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections. This childhood disorder results from a Group A Streptococcal bacterial infection commonly referred to as “strep” or “strep throat”.

    Following infection with strep, children with PANDAS syndrome develop severe physical, neurological, and psychological symptoms that interfere with their daily lives. Thankfully, we can treat this disorder in addition to alleviating the symptoms after the child has received a PANDAS diagnosis from a qualified health professional.
    
    What is the prevalence of PANDAS in the United States?
    Research from our network of parents and physicians, the PANDAS Network, suggests that 1 in 200 children in the United States alone have PANDAS. This is a staggering number, especially considering that many doctors, medical professionals, and clinicians do not recognize PANDAS as an autoimmune disease. Unfortunately, many children go untreated, sometimes experiencing debilitating symptoms for years until finding the cause and visiting a PANDAS specialist.

  <h1>What is Pandas</h1>

  <p>
Giant pandas help to keep their mountain forests healthy by spreading seeds in their droppings, which helps vegetation to thrive.

The Giant panda’s forested habitat is also important for local people – for food, income and fuel for cooking and heating. The pandas live in the mountain catchment areas of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, whose river basins are the economic heart of China, home to over half a billion people.

Panda habitat rivals the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem in the world. It's also vitally important for other threatened and endangered species, including golden snub-nosed monkeys, takins, red pandas and snow leopards. 

By protecting pandas in the wild we’re helping conserve the wider environment, for the people and wildlife that depend on it.  </p>
